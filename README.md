# Questions and Answers

### Q1. What is PHP?
   - PHP stands for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor is a widely used open-source server-side scripting language especially suited for creating dynamic websites and mobile APIs.
   - It is used to manage dynamic content, session tracking, databases, and also to build an entire e-commerce site. 
   - By default, most of the web hosting servers support PHP, and thus it contributes to cost-effectiveness.
   
### Q2. What is the difference between variables and constants?
   - Variables:
      Variables are used to store data values.
      The value of a variable can be changed during the execution of a script.
      You declare a variable using the $ symbol, for example, $variableName.
      Variables are handy when you need to work with data that can change or is unknown at the time of writing the code.
   - Constants:
      Constants are used to store fixed values that do not change during the execution of a script.
      Once a constant is defined, it cannot be changed or redefined.
      You declare a constant using the define() function or the const keyword, for example, define("CONSTANT_NAME", "constant value"); or const CONSTANT_NAME = "constant value";.
      Constants are useful when you want to ensure that a value remains constant throughout your code.
