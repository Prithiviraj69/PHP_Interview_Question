### Q2. What is the difference between variables and constants?
   - **Variables:**
     - Variables are used to store data values.
     - The value of a variable can be changed during the execution of a script.
     - You declare a variable using the $ symbol, for example, $variableName.
     - Variables are handy when you need to work with data that can change or is unknown at the time of writing the code.
   - **Constants:**
     - Constants are used to store fixed values that do not change during the execution of a script.
     - Once a constant is defined, it cannot be changed or redefined.
     - You declare a constant using the define() function or the const keyword, for example, define("CONSTANT_NAME", "constant value"); or const CONSTANT_NAME = "constant value";.
     - Constants are useful when you want to ensure that a value remains constant throughout your code.

### Q4. Is PHP a case-sensitive scripting language?
   - The answer to this is both yes and no. Variables and their declaration in PHP are completely case-sensitive while function names are not.
   - For example, user-defined functions in PHP can be defined in uppercase but later referred to in lowercase, and it would still function normally.
